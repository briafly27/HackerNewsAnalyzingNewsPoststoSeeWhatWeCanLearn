Based on this analysis, to maximize the amount of comments a post receives, I'd recommend the post be categorized as an ask post and created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm EST - 4:00 pm EST).\n",

Given that, it's more accurate to say that _of the posts that received comments_, ask posts received more comments on average and ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm EST - 4:00 pm EST) received the most comments on average."
